I remember him always struggling to rotate strike as well as(and especially) clearing the rope.  Good for him.look at all those kiwi kids growing up not knowing how life was before the scary super overThis is why Rahul is great at 5 because he can hit 6s easilyIf Latham was captaining Santner wouldn't have fluffed that.Everyone's gangsta until the Thakur arrivesImagine once Rohit, Dhawan, Pandya and Bhuvi are all back.

Bowling looks real solid without Southee, or even Bennett for that matter. Southee has been fantastic for us for years and he's still got the tests to show us his worth but his LOI time is coming to an end..\"we're thinking of our thingy\" ???This is what I imagined last game going like chasing 272I have my gully cricket tournament finals today bois, wish me luck. Playing with a tape ball.Rahul's purple patch seems to be endless. Hope he's able to continue this till the WT20.I like the way our desi crowd shows up.

Because they've already set the precedent of selecting Rohit based on his LOI form.Say what you will but Dhoni was the master of acceleration without losing wicketsShardul is a better pinch hitter than Jadeja don't change my mindThakur gonna cunt one to a six this overReally shitting the bed here.Lmfao Shit gets hit and Shit gets wicket. Pure village.How tf did he complete that runSouthee to concede 10 off 2 for Indias 300Saini average watch: 53.00Neesham should've bowled instead of southee. Southee should be kept away from death over for some time. Latham did wonderfully last match.With the form he's in rcb should send saini to open the battingThey really love that joke lolGuptill's playing on a different pitchGuppy got all of his misses out of the way during the CWCguptill is getting the orange cap at the t20wcRemember when Munro was our opener?

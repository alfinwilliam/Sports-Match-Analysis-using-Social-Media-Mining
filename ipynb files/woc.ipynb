( Will start praying for Kohli to get his rhythm back too ).Who just nutted in the commentary box from that shot? lmaoHow come no Indian batsmen bowl part time any more? If a frontline bowler is being taken apart, then they have no choice but to make him bowl 10 overs - this lack of flexibility is hurting India.Bumrah not bowling economically and/or not taking wickets makes me unhappy.
